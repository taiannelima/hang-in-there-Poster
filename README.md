# Hang in There
### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built an interactive webpage that allows a user to see a variety of motivational posters, create a unique poster, save different posters that the user sees fit, and can delete any posters of their choosing.
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Go to our repo in Github-- it's called hang-in-there-Poster. Fork our repo and clone it in your terminal!
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
**Screenshot is attached under readme-imgs**. The screenshot demonstrates the functionality of being able to create your own poster! You can include any image, title, and quote of your choosing.
### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We worked on this project for several days and many, many hours!! We just concluded our second week of Turing.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goal was to see Javascript in action! It was cool to see code we wrote allow us to interact with the webpage. We also got to experience working in a team environment.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
There were many wins! The project really drove home the importance of good naming conventions. With so many querySelectors, addEventListeners, and functions, we saw the importance of needing to name them appropriately to help piece out what piece of code is doing what. It also brought to light how pseudocoding can provide a great framework/structure for exactly what we need the code to do. In a way, it provides step-by-step instructions! Some challenges were knowing what the code needs to execute, but not knowing HOW. There was a lot of time spent researching, googling, watching videos, and asking for help from developers themselves!
